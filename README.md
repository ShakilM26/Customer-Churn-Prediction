# Customer Churn Prediction

## Description
The project uses the following steps:

* 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
* 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: New features are created from the existing features to improve the accuracy of the model.
* 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: The data is trained on a variety of machine learning models, including KNN, Decision tree, Linear Regression, gradient boosting model and finally using ML Ensemble.
* 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The models are evaluated on a holdout dataset to determine their accuracy.




## Installation

Use the package manager #pip to install all these module.

pip install pandas

pip install matplotlib

pip install seaborn

pip install sklearn
## Responsibilities 

* Read data and data preprocessing using pandas. 
* Visualize insights using viz libraries.
* For improve accuracy of the model create some new feature from the existing feature using LabelEncoder.
* Using Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting model.
## Results

The best model achieved an accuracy of 99%
